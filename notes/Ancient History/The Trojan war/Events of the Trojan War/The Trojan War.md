In a visit to Sparta to meet his acquaintance, King Menelaus, the Trojan prince Paris would fall in love with the wife of Menelaus, Helen. Angry, hurt and betrayed, Menelaus would ask his brother King Agamemnon for help. Agamemnon would request King Priam, the father of Paris, to return Helen but his request would be rejected. Agamemnon would then declare war on Troy, sparking the decade-long Trojan War. The goddesses Athena and Hera would support the Greeks and Agamemnon, while Aphrodite supports the Trojans and Paris. The intervention of the goddesses in the war would play a huge part in how the war turned out as the Greeks (Achaeans) would often be extremely close to victory only to lose in the very last minute due to Aphrodite's intervention. The same can be said about Athena and Hera's interventions.

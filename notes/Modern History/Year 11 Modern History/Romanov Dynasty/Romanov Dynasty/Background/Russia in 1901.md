3. **Describe the terrain of European Russia.**
	  The terrain of European Russia is relatively flat and is divided from the Asian part by the Ural Mountains and the Ural river
4. **What term means the enforcement of Russian language and culture onto non-Russians?**
	  Russification refers to the enforcement of the Russian language and culture onto non-Russians
5. **Suggest 2 factors which might suggest autocracy was a natural form of government for Russia.**
	  Autocracy was a natural form of government of Russia due to it's vastly diverse terrain and cultures and the lack of a dominant culture making it difficult to get decisions made democratically. 
6. **Identify 3 reasons why Russia was economically behind the rest of Europe.**  
	 Russia was behind the rest of Europe due to their backward and extremely inefficient farming methods. Despite 80% of the population farming and producing for the kingdom, the methods used were primitive, there was a lack of scientific innovation amongst farmers and farming was carried out largely labour-intensive by over-taxed, ill-educated and hungry peasants.
	 
	 Another reason included the lack of industrial production amongst the Russians compared to other European nations, still focusing on extremely inefficient forms of subsistence farming to increase the economy. Steel production was a half of Britain's and a third of the US',  cotton textiles was a fourth of Britain's and a third of the United States'. Coal production was, by far, the worst metric that the Russians' possessed, roughly around a tenth of Britain's and a seventeenth of the United States. 
	 
	 Finally, the reason for Russia's lack of economic growth compared to Europe is due to the autocratic dynasty, which heavily taxed the peasants of the land and redirected the flow of income back to themselves, making it harder for the economy to grow. Due to the dynasty's wide-reaching power, their poor decisions also meant that the entire country was at risk, as due to their lack of initiative when it came to implementing mining and industrial production put them far behind the rest of their European peers, despite having a vastly greater amount of natural resources to fund industrial production. 
	
	 a) Predict what problems might the Romanovs face because of its economic situation. 
		 Due to the poor economic situation in Russia, the Romanovs might face a lack of trust in the government, greater discontent with the government and rising influence from dissenting groups might lead to a revolution or the rule of a different leader in place of the Romanovs.

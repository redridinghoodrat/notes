| Germany       | Relations with Germany were extremely hostile on both sides, with Russia going to war with Germany in 1901                                                                                                                                               |

| France        | France became Russia's closest ally, forming the Triple Entente with Britain and aiming to encircle the German Empire and weaken them                                                                                                                    |
| United States | The US and Russia maintained a rivalry in the Near-East, as both had similar imperialist ideals shared by both nations but due to U.S intervention during the Russo-Japanese wars and disagreements over the Tsarist autocracy caused major differences. |
| Japan         | Japan's relationship with Russia was initially extremely negative after the Russo-Japanese war. However, as time passed, relations improved and Japan fought alongside Russia against Germany by late August 1914 in WW1                                 |
q2. What do the defeats in the Crimean War and Russo-Japanese War reveal about Russia's position in the world during the 19th century.

Russia had large amounts of land and manpower compared to other nations, but they lacked similarly large technological advancements and was far behind much of their peers. This backwardness was established in the Crimean and Japanese wars as these wars showed that Russia had outdated ships, incompetent and undertrained soldiers and a lack of proper military strategy.

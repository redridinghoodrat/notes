### [[Relationship with foreign powers|Historical Context]]


### What is foreign policy?

- Foreign policy is how a country conducts itself diplomatically and negotiate with nations for a variety of reasons. These include
	- Trade in natural resources or goods produced 
	- Peace treaties and restoring stability to a region
	- Creating alliances and ensuring safety to each other
	- Defending against foreign enemies
	- Impose sanctions on nations
- This means that foreign policy is made up of different global issues, relationship with other countries and even domestic politics. 

### Russia's foreign policy

- During the 18th and 19th centuries, Russia's relationship with foreign powers was centred around the Near East and Far West and it's interest in territorial expansion
- This interest wasn't just limited to land but rather, ports which allowed easy naval routing. The already existing naval ports that Russia obtained were majority unusable and declared cold ports.

Russia's foreign policy centred on *three* essential elements:

- Continuous concern about the European balance of power and how it affected global security
- Russia was a major imperial power but was focused on land based, as opposed to Britain's naval capacity
- Russia's major concern was its efforts to gain a warm seaport in the Near East. 

### [[French invasion of Russia]]
- Napoleon and his Grand Armee cross into Russia to engage and defeat the Russian army in June 1812
- Napoleon wanted to force Tsar Alexander I to stop trading with British merchants and exert pressure on Britain
- French army of 600,000 was defeated, primarily because of the harsh winter and lack of resources
- Moscow was destroyed by fire
- Napoleon's reputation was destroyed by the defeat of this conflict and major powers were less likely to agree to Napoleon's demands

### The Crimean War
- In 1853, Russia went to war against the Ottomans to expand it's power in the Balkan region
- Britain and France intervened on the side of Turkey and by 1856, Russia had lost
- Despite its massive resources and manpower, Russia lacked the industrial capacity to supply an army, the communications to transport men and products to the front line
- The lack of modernised industry was affecting the last defence for the army

### [[The Russo-Japanese War]]

- In 1905, Russia went to war against Japan over influence in Manchuria and Korea
- Although Russia had a much larger fleet than Japan, it was defeated mainly because many of its ships were outdated and crews were not well-trained
- This was the first time an Asian nation defeated a major European power. At the time, the notion that this could happenw as unthinkable in Russia
- It was a humiliating disaster
- As a result, ordinary people whose lives were already difficult suffered even more and [[The Decline and Fall of the Romanov Dynasty|discontent with the Tsarist dynasty grew significantly]]

### [[European alliances form]]

- Between 1876-1907, many European empires were beginning to form alliances with each other in the aim of protecting and advancing their interests
- Across Europe, there was a growing sense of suspicion, competition and tension that led to many of these empires distrusting each other
- In 1892, Russia and France form an alliance to assist each other if either was attacked- this was in response to the growing power of Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy.
- Similarly, in 1907, Russia makes an agreement with Britain leading it the Triple Entente being formed
	- Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy formed the Triple Alliance

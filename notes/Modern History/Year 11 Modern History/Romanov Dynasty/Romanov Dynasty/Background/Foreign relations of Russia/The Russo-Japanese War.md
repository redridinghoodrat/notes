### Causes of the Russo-Japanese War
#### Imperialism
- Russia's interest in the Near East for economic and strategic gan
- Russia’s intention of establishing a permanent presence in Manchuria, clashed with plans that Japan had for the area, and its control over Korea
- Russia was interested in occupying the resources in the area and the possibility to have a military presence in the Pacific Ocean
- Relations between Japan and Russia broke down, and by 1904 they were at war


### How did the Russo-Japanese war also contribute to the grievances felt?
- At February 1904, Russia found itself at war with Japan
- It was assumed that Japan would be easily defeated by Russia due to it's sheer size
- Russia's racist notion of superiority had much to do with this attitude
- Proved to be catastrophic for Russia, with both its military and naval forces suffering embarrassing defeats
- Japan was now viewed as a great power, whereas the consequences of Russia’s humiliation were enormous as events escalated beyond the regime’s control

### Outcomes
- Contributed to the uprising of 1905
- First time a European power had been defeated by an Asian nation in a war
- The Battle of Tsushima (May 1905) contributed to the image of Nicholas II as an unprofessional, incompetent autocrat, with Russian soldiers being highly unprofessional and untrained and Japanese soldiers being highly disciplined and respectable.

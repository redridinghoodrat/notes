Before the founding of the Romanov dynasty in the early 1600s, Russia was politically fragmented and economically undeveloped. This was known as the time of the troubles as it was characterised by its chaotic internal disorders, foreign invasions and rapid succession of rulers

- The house of Romanov would reign over Russia for 304 years, from 1613-1917. Eighteen different Romanov autocrats ruled Russia throughout the dynasty and between them, over time, the Romanovs established the modern world's largest and most powerful empire
### The effects of expansion

- Increasing ethnic diversity lead to the Romanov Empire being home to around 70 distinct nationalities and a total population of 126 million people. 
- Half of the Russian Empire ended up being classified as "foreigners" due to their own languages, customs and way of life
- The Russian Empire was still a largely agrarian economy, which relied on the growth of crops for survival and trade

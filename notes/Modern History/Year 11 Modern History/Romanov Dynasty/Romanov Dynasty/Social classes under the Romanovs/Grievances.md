Peasants faced harsh punishments for resisting authority. The government used censorship, exile, and force (such as through the Okhrana, the secret police) to suppress dissent. | Peasants were resentful of modernisation as it did not benefit them in any way, they lived in overcrowded huts and most of their income went to the nobility who still dominated the agricultural industry which the peasants worked in.  | The peasants, alongside their poor wages in general, had to pay redemption payments and lived in poor conditions with whole families living in one room.     |

SEAL PARAGRAPH:
**Account for the grievances and increasing discontent under Nicholas II.**

Under Tsar Nicholas II, growing repression, economic and social inequality fueled discontent and grievances. Nicholas II upheld the autocratic regime his father Alexander III initiated, refusing to reform the system amidst growing calls for democracy. Peasants and proleteriat were at risk of getting tortured or killed by the Okhrana, the secret police of Tsar Nicholas, for voicing dissent. Political discontent reached a boiling point with Bloody Sunday Massacre, a brutal repression of protesters, breaking the peasants and proleteriat's trust in the Tsar as their father. The peasants suffered from land shortages, high taxes and poverty while industrial workers suffered from long working hours, unsafe working conditions and extremely crowded living spaces. Nicholas' industrialisation process also harmed relations with the nobility, losing another large chunk of their power after the emancipation of the serfs. The hardships following the defeats in the Russo-Japanese war and World War I caused food shortages and economic collapse, eroding the nobility's confidence in him as a leader. Ultimately, Nicholas IIâ€™s refusal to adapt to changing political and economic realities led to his downfall, resulting in the February Revolution of 1917, which forced his abdication and marked the end of Tsarist rule in Russia.

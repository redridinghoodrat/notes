Most western powers were seeing changes in their political systems, growing towards a democratic system of power. This change was not reflected in Russia. Nicholas, as a Tsar, was uncompromising and refused to let politics develop inside his nation
	 There was no possibility of achieving political change in a peaceful, evolutionary manner
	 Demands of political change were seen as threats to Russia, and met with harsh repressive measures
	 The autocracy's refusal to listen to these groups led to the radicalisation of these groups and created an unrealistic image of Russia
After the peaceful attempt at revolution was met with violent oppression in Bloody Sunday, these groups turned towards violence to fight violence.

### Violent revolutionary groups

- The second half of the 19th century saw an appearance of several violent revolutionary groups
- They were a result of 3 key factors:
	- Injustices of the tsarist system
	- Dissatisfaction with the reforms of the 1860s
	- The lack of an alternative form of protest
- Although some revolutionary groups could be shocking and dramatic, the regime's existence was never truly threatened by them
- Once the upheavals of 1905 had been overcome, these groups remained "irritants" rather than a fundamental threat to the regime until 1914.

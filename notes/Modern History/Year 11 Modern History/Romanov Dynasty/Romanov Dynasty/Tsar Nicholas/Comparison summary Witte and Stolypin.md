**Witte & Stolypin: A Comparison**

**Instructions:** Read the information on *Witte and Stolypin: Potential saviours of Tsarism* and complete the following table: 

|  | Witte | Stolypin |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| **What were their aims? How did they attempt to modernise/improve Russia?**  | Witte aimed to bring about industrialisation and develop industry in the vastly backwards Tsarist Russia, which would result in higher wages and cheaper goods, calming social unrest.   | Stolypin wanted to solve the peasant question, the largest social class in the country and a factor that would determine the support of the duma. He wanted the peasants to be split into impoverished, and “well-to-do” peasants who would be able to create independent farms that would add to the economy.  |
| **Summarise the reforms they introduced** | Witte introduced econonomic reforms, increasing industrialisation such as: Foreign investment from other countries Protective tariffs to safeguard Russia’s industries against the more competitive and stronger European economies Placing the Russian rouble on the gold standard to inspire confidence from foreign countries Invested into the Trans-Siberian railway which would link Moscow and Vladivostok, encouraging the migration of workers and increasing Russia’s production | Stolypin introduced economic reforms, increasing peasant rights and their social stature such as: making all crown and state lands available to the Peasants’ Land Bank for purchase by enterprising peasants Peasants were allowed to withdraw from their commune. Peasants who left their commune were able to have their land together, rather than in strips Redistribution of land became hereditary property of the head of the family |
| **Assess the success of their reforms** | The success of Witte’s reforms are limited as Nicholas was unhappy with the shift of his autocracy to a constitutional monarchy in his eyes.  | This success of Stolypin’s reforms were high initially but began to reduce after Stolypin’s brutal oppression of the people he sought to gain the support of.  |
| **Identify any criticisms of their decisions/effectiveness to implement change and resolve political and economic tensions** | Witte’s reforms, mainly the Trans-Siberian railway, went half baked and parts of the railway were unfinished when he was in the Duma. His reforms also didn’t address the peasantry who made up a large majority of the populace which increased discontent with his reforms. Most of his reforms were changed after Nicholas dismissed him | Stolypin’s reforms, while addressing the needs of the peasants, didn’t do enough to address the concerns of the proletariat and was not enough to clearly progress the country forwards. This, coupled with Stolypin’s use of violence, made his reforms ultimately harm the people he sought to support.  |

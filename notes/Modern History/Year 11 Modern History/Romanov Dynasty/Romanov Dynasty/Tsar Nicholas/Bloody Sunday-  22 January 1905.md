### Background 

- There was major unrest in the countryside and the cities with both peasants and workers living desperate lives of deprivation
- Middle class Russians were angry at the lack of political reform and increased danger from terrorist activity from various revolutionary groups. 
- Harvest failures became commonplace after 1900
- Food prices were rising throughout 1904
- Real wages were steadily falling since 1900
- Russia had been at war with Japan since February 1904
	- As a result of incompetent leadership, lack of economic planning and budget, lack of supplies and superior planning from the Japanese caused massive Russian casualties
- In January 1905, workers at the Putilov Steel works at St Petersburg organised protests

### Context

- Took place on a freezing Sunday morning on the 9th of January 1905, Father Georgii Gapon, led a march of tens of thousands of workers, carrying a petition. 
- The petition called for:
	- civil liberties such as freedom of speech
	- measures to alleviate poverty
	- improved working conditions such as an 8 hour day
	- political representation, elections for a constiituent assembly, free and equal voting rights
- It had a crippling effect on the Tsarist government, where it had demonstrated for the first time a widespread contempt for the regime
- During the march, they carried a picture of the Tsar, icons and banners borrowed from the churches
- They demanded for the state to intervene to improve working and living conditions, a demand for civil liberties- freedom of press,speech assembly, beliefs, unions and strikes.

- The Tsar left town, and wasn't met by the marchers
- As the crowd approached the building, they were ordered to disband by troops
- Some of the guards panicked and opened fire. A bloody massacre ensued. 
- Estimated that 200 were killed and 800 were wounded. 
- Started a revolution, where in the weeks that followed, the number of strikes and strikers in 1905 was greater that in all previous years of Russian history combined 
	- Labour movement became more organised
	- Trade unions began to appear
	- New types of worker organisations, councils or worker representatives called soviets appeared for the first time
	- Worker demands were more political 
	- Workers were angrier now as they felt they didn't want a Tsar if this was the way he was prepared to treat his people, demanding a constitutional republic and full civil liberties. The status of "Little father" that the Tsar possessed was rejected. 

- As a result of all the revolutionary action against the Tsar, a common desire was to have an elected parliament to represent the Russian people, which was called a Duma
- Sergei Witte, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and persuaded the Tsar to issue the "October Manifesto", which promised to grant a measure of representative government- signed on October 17th 
- The October Manifesto saw, for the first time in Russian history, basic civil liberties granted to all Russians
- Russia was about to become a constitutional monarchy
- The October Manifesto:
	- granted basic civil liberties to all Russians
	- provided for the creation of an elected parliament called the Duma with the power to make laws
	- It also established the right to form political parties
- While the reforms seemed to promise real change, they did not go far enough for a lot of the everyday people
- For instance, there were no provisions to alleviate poverty or improve working conditions
- Nicholas disliked the Manifesto.
- On 16 December 1905, the St Petersburg soviet was closed and 190 of its members arrested
- A general strike in Moscow led to street fighting from 21 December to 2 January 1906, resulting in defeat for the strikers and the deaths of more than 1000 workers
- Nicholas tried to reassert his position by using a series of Fundamental laws on 2 May 1906, as he had bitterly resented to have to concede a Duma


### Fundamental Laws

- They were announced before the Duma met
- On the surface, the laws confirmed an October Manifesto, but they also placed the Duma under the tsar's control
- Nicholas had the right to:
	- Appoint his own ministers
	- Legislate by decree without consultation with the Duma
	- Refuse to approve laws passed by the duma (all laws passed by the duma needed his approval)
	- Control foreign policy
	- Appoint members to an Imperial Council which would share power with the Duma


### The Dumas

There were 4 Dumas from 1906-1917
1. 1906: Dominated by the Kasdets, only lasted 2 months before being shut down by the Tsar for pushing too many radical changes
2. 1907: Included more representatives from radical parties but was shut down in 4 months
3. Third (1907-12): Didn't include many radicals but lasted longer compared o the preceding 2 and had lack of impact on key problems facing most citizens
4. Fourth (1913-17): Final duma, conservative like the third duma, it criticised the Tsar and the way they were waging war in WW1, some members became the leaders of the Provisional Government 


Summary Question

3. What events occurred on the 22nd January for it to be known as “Bloody Sunday”?
	  The peaceful protest was met with intense violence and massacre from the Russian Imperial military which created the sentiment of a "Bloody Sunday"
4. How did the perception of Nicholas II change after the march?
	  Nicholas II was perceived as a "Little Father", only under the big Father that is God. He was seen as a figure that only wants to protect the peasants and knew of their struggles. After the brutal crackdown on protests in Bloody Sunday, the public turned against Nicholas II as they felt they would no longer live under a Tsar who was prepared to kill his own people.

6. Outline the purpose of the October Manifesto.
	  The October Manifesto was drafted to appease the tensions raised by the public and revolutionary groups by creating a constitutional, elected parliament. However, this parliament could be dissolved by Nicholas II at any point and had no real power. 
7. How effective was the October Manifesto in easing tension between Nicholas and his people?
	 The October Manifesto eased the tensions between the higher class nobility who wanted a constitutional liberal monarchy while only intensified tensions with other revolutionary groups who wanted to depose of the monarchy and create a complete democratic state.Do you think the events in 1905 were inevitable?

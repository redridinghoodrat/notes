1. What attitudes, beliefs, values, and vision had Tsar Nicholas II adopted, through his family upbringing and education?
	 Tsar Nicholas II believed strongly in the autocratic system that was in place for 300 years since his birth. He believed that he had divine right over the Russians and he believed he was always supposed to be the Tsar. Nicholas was also deeply Christian, practicing Russian Orthodox Christianity, which made him develop a great sense of antisemitism and nationalism during his rule. 
	 
2. Under Tsar Nicholas II, Russia was a police state. List 5 features of this repression.
	 Secret police: Nicholas made use of the Okhrana, a secret police to control his populace
	 Censorship: Nicholas widely censored information and dissent around him
	 Political suppression: Political parties were made illegal until 1905 and were made strictly controlled from then to the February Revolution
	 
3. Tsar Nicholas II had absolute power.
	a. Explain the term absolute power.
		Absolute power is defined as exercising power over a large population, politically, economically and socially and stifling the peoples' ability to dissent or voice concerns
	b. Explain in your own words how Nicholas II exercised absolute power.
		 Nicholas II had absolute political power in his autocracy, with no political parties until 1905 threatening his own status and power. There were little economic freedoms for the people under Nicholas II, with much of the people's incomes getting taxed. Social concerns and issues were never tackled or talked about as Nicholas II stifled dissent violently as seen in Bloody Sunday. 
4. In your own words, explain how the historian Richard Pipes describes the Russian peasants’ traditional relationship to, and views of the Tsar.
	 Traditionally, the peasants respected the Tsar as God's vicar on Earth, sent by god to give them orders and take care of them. They believed the Tsar had their best interests at heart always and every peasant would be warmly welcomed at the Winter Palace
5. What were Nicholas II’s initial reactions and thoughts about becoming the next tsar?
	 Nicholas claimed he was not prepared to be Tsar and was apprehensive about taking on the role of Tsar. 
6. What role did his wife Tsarina Alexandra play in her husband’s role as leader? How would you judge this role? Justify your answer.
	 Tsarina Alexandra added to Nicholas' wildly inefficient and indecisive rule by urging him not to take others' advice, claiming it undermined his own power. She solidified the ideas of autocracy in Nicholas' head and Nicholas took great interest in his wife's opinions. This made Nicholas' rule extremely weak and made the public develop a hatred towards not only Nicholas but also Alexandra and the entire extended family.

1. Read the primary and secondary source quotes from Nicholas II’s contemporaries and from historians who have commented on and made an assessment of Nicholas II’s character and qualities. List the positive and negative features of Tsar Nicholas II mentioned in these sources and assess his character, as revealed in these sources.
	

| Positive characteristics/features                                                | Negative characteristics/features                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tsar Nicholas was very determined to uphold the autocracy his father established | He was not prepared to be an autocrat                                                           |
| He learned quickly and easily                                                    | He didn't like hearing the professional opinions and reports of his ministers                   |
| He was extremely charming                                                        | He never had an opinion of his own and agreed with whatever opinions his ministers posed on him |
| He was trained as a soldier, a field he had expertise in                         | He was not taught how to be a statesman                                                         |
|                                                                                  | He had little to no presence as a commanding figure                                             |
|                                                                                  |                                                                                                 |


2. Which of these (consider all of them) assessments and sources do you find most convincing? Explain why.
	I find Source 5 most convincing, "He never had an opinion of his own...he always agreed with the last thing he heard", as it comes from the Grand Duke, advisor and brother-in law of Nicholas II, Alexander Mikhailovich. Mikhailovich was likely very close to Nicholas II but him providing a negative opinion of him holds more weight as he is likely being honest about how Nicholas truly was

3. Which source/s do you find least convincing, problematic or untrustworthy? Why?
	 Source 2 is the least convincing as all it says is, "Nicholas II was not fit to run a village post office" and it is not known who the information comes from and if whether he had any experience alongside Nicholas II at all. 
4. Discuss why there would be different perspectives of Nicholas?
	 Nicholas was very loved amongst the royals and upper class of Russia, who regarded him a fine leader, albeit with little dominant features. However, the middle, lower and peasant classes of Russia heavily disliked Nicholas II as he was extremely repressive, made poor decisions that harmed the economy of Russia, led them into wars which they ultimately lost and had no conviction of his own on any issue besides war.

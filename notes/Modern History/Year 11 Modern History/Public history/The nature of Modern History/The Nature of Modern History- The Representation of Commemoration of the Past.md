## What is the nature of 'history'

The nature of history follows that of a narrative- compiling countless perspectives to form a definitive account of an event, following what happened to lead-up to this event and how to prevent it in the future. History differs based on interpretation, much like literature. The view with more corroborating evidence and less logical loopholes are considered the more reliable perspective. 
* Recognising patterns
* Facts
* Historical periods
* Essays
* Reliability
	* Audience
	* Motive/agenda
	* Bias/prejudice
	* Context 

### Extension question: What is 'public history' ?

Public history is any piece of history that the public can readily accessible and is widely available with countless perspectives and pieces of evidence supporting it. In contrast to academic history, public history is much more  
Examples include:
* The Holocaust
* World War 1 & 2 
* 9/11
* The War in Iraq
## Where do we see and experience history?

We can see and experience history in **two** different ways. One if history is literally being **made in the present** (e.g: a presidential election happened, a new pandemic started, global recession etc.) or if we are studying history and/or its **effects on the present** (e.g: the effects of the 2008 recession today, the effects of the Iraq War on people of color and/or from the Middle East and South Asia, museums). History is **everywhere**. It is in the history books written by academics in universities, and it is in the events and exhibitions of art exhibitions, libraries, heritage consultancies and historical associations. But history is also part of the way, as individuals and as groups, **we make sense of who we are and where we come from.** It is in the games children play and the ways we tell stories. 
* Local: school, museums, war memorials
	* PHS 1913: artefacts, past students/headshots, richies, roll of honour
* Nation: ANZAC Day, Old Parliament house
* Global: Monuments, Wonders of the World, films, documentaries, books
### Public history academically

Public history is interested in **understanding** how histories are made and **interpreted** in the broader community, it has been defined as a practice of history by academically trained historians working for public agencies or freelancers outside of the universities. Public historians help examine phenomena such as: 
* the changing commemoration of Anzac Day in Australia
* the current debates about historical monuments
* the ways that certain family histories are remembered and forgotten
### Public history as a practice

* **It is a way of doing history FOR and WITH public audiences**
	* This kind of public history is sometimes informed by the history done inside universities, but it's aim is to engage with the broader community, through preserving our culture, providing services, and facilitating access to information. 
		* Public historians may work in:
			* heritage conservation
			* commissioned history
			* museums
			* the media including radio, tv and film 
			* education including universities
				* They are people who have asked: "What is history for?"
					* They are concerned with addressing the relationship between audience, practice and social context
		Examples of Public History:
			- Museums, libraries and art galleries
			- Memorials
			- Documentaries/films, TV series, and books
			- Archives
			- Public holidays, annual celebrations, public services, marches and parades
			- Physical places- the Western Front, Galipolli, or historic estates such as Elizabeth Farm
			- Public monuments such as statues


### [[Questions on Public History]]

#### Commemoration and representation
* The past can be represented in many ways, but for what purpose and by whom?
* Politicians, institutions, the media, educators, museums, films and events often reflect a political perspective
* Commemoration refers to acts of collective rememberance
	* Symbolic significance repeated over time
	* Form "memories" of a nation or people that help define who they are and where they come from
	* Political leaders can use these acts of collective rememberence to promote core values considered importance to the success of the nations
	* In Australia, consider commemorative events such as Anzac Day

##### Positive aspects of commemoration:
* Can be enjoyable that opens historical events in a way that makes a personal impact
* Promotes acknowledgement by pointing to a legacy of the past that still has importance for today
* Helps define national identity
* Has potential to help develop or renew relationship between opposing groups by working together to bring conflicting views of history together for a shared purpose

##### Negative aspects of commemoration
* Can also be difficult, divisive or painful
* Is used to ritualise and harden boundaries between groups who have been in conflicts, causing division
* Competing groups can try to control the meaning of commemoration
* Can feel that the story about certain historical events gets taken over by other groups for their own purposes
* Can lead to the forgetting of other dimensions of historical fact that contradict or complicate the agreed story

## Degroot

**How does De Groot define public history ?

De Groot defines public history as anything that relates to the past out of common academic/educational settings such as universities and highschool. This includes but is not limited to museums, archives, cultural institutions, TV and film, games, adverts and so on. 

**What do you understand as the meaning of “power of authority”

The term “power of authority” means the control that the state has over our education, our freedom of speech and expression and limits they can impose on us economically if we reach outside of our given bounds of freedom and expression or seek further education beyond what’s just given to us. 

**What do you understand as the meaning of “consuming history”.

The act of “consuming history” is to actively go out and experience history. This can be the act of researching about different historical events on a site like Wikipedia or going to a museum to see different exhibits such as ones about Tutankhamun. Experiencing history doesn’t need to be academic necessarily, for instance, one can experience history even in the context of entertainment through games (take games like Hearts of Iron 4) or movies (1914, Oppenheimer). 

  

**How is tourism linked to this?

Many countries like Greece and Egypt base a huge amount of their tourist campaign around history and consuming history. This includes visiting sites like the Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, the ruins of Rome and so on. 

**Explain how family historians are public historians.


**What part does genetics play ?


**What is the state of public history today ? Give some examples.

  

Public history is currently the only real form of resistance against historical revisionism or censorship. It’s much harder to censor a form of history that most, if not all, people have easy access to. For instance, during World War 2, history that was aimed to be destroyed by the Nazis were archived by public historians in Europe and the United States. Public history is also becoming more and more expansive in the modern day, with the development of social media. For instance, information on ancient history such as ancient Arab societies and their cultures are becoming more well-known.

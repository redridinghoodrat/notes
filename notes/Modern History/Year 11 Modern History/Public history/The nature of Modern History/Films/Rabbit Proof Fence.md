Critical Analysis of an Historical Film

You are to complete a critical analysis of a popular historical film, _Rabbit Proof Fence_ (2002), Director: Phillip Noyce. You do NOT necessarily have to view the film, as this task is more about your ability to research and evaluate information.

Complete the following scaffold to conduct a critical analysis of your chosen film. You may use information from your textbook in combination with internet research.

**_A few important points on internet research:_**

- **_Strongly consider your key words:_** Ensure that your keywords are specific rather than broad. For example, if you type “Gallipoli” into Google, you will need to search through a number of pages before locating anything on the film. Refine your search by entering specific information such as the year of the film and/or the director. Consider other key terms such as “Gallipoli film criticism”, “Peter Weir Gallipoli critical review”. Try a number of phrases and note the different results they produce
- **_Consider the credibility of websites_**_:_ Try to use scholarly websites and journal articles as much as possible. Sign up for a NSW State Library card to access scholarly databases or use google scholar.
- **_Skim read articles:_** The key ideas will generally be present in the introduction and conclusion, it is a good idea to read this closely and skim read the rest of the article or document to determine if it is useful.
- **_Save all useful websites!_** Bookmark or keep a list in a word document of all your articles. Not only to ensure you have all your references for our bibliography, but the direction of your research may change and you might want to revisit articles you’ve read.

1. Provide a summary of the Historical Events/Personalities/Issues portrayed in the film.
	 Rabbit Proof Fence follows the story of Molly Pilkington and her siblings Daisy and Gracie, their escape from the Moore River internment camp and the 1600km chase to find them. 

**_Handy Hints:_**

- A summary is a very brief overview of what the film is about.
- Identify the key events depicted in the film and the focus/perspective of the film

2. . Identify any cinematic techniques that convey particular historical issues or ideas.
	Rabbit-Proof Fence makes use of archival footage to create a sense of time and place, conveying the attitudes towards Indigenous people and mixed-race Indigenous people in 1931. The use of costuming also helps indicate the ethos at the time of "cleanliness" with the white starched uniforms almost resembling straitjackets. The ethos "Cleanliness is next to godliness" was manipulated and used to wash away the Indigenous identity, deeming Indigenous people as unclean. The shot of the girls aggressively ripped out of their mothers arms is used to showcase the horrors of institutionalised racism. 

**_Handy Hints:_**

- Cinematic Techniques may include: costuming, appearance of character, scenery, colour, camera angles, lighting and sound. Basically, anything that a director has chosen to include in the film to convey meaning or a particular idea.
- Consider how these techniques are used to represent ideas about the past. Are certain historical figures made to look powerful through colour or symbolism? Does the film dramatize particular historical events through the use of emotive music? Etc.

3. What aspects of the film have been praised by critics or historians for its accurate representation of the past?
	 The film has been praised by critics and historians for it's accurate representation of the Stolen Generation and the conditions of the internment camps the Indigenous people had to go to. 

**_Handy Hints_**

- Remember to reference any ideas you are using from your research.
- Consider issues of reliability and usefulness
- What are the positive comments Historians have made about the film?
- Identify what perspective the film takes on the historical issue it portrays (for example: is it critical of America’s involvement in the Vietnam War? How does it convey this criticism?)
- Have certain aspects been dramatized or downplayed? Have central figures or events been excluded?

4. . What are some of the issues of contestability, criticism, inaccuracies or limitations of this film?
	 The film was criticised for making the character of AO Neville too sympathetic or "soft" by Indigenous voices. The film was considered "inaccurate"by  Keith Windschuttle who wrote that "Molly and the two girls were removed for their own welfare and their sexual relations with white men", but this claim was widely contested as the research was deemed incomplete, excessive bias against Aboriginal people and Pilkington Garimara (the daughter of Molly Pilkington) coming out to state the claims were a distortion of history and they were untrue. 

**_Handy Hints_**

- Identify what perspective the film takes on the historical issue it portrays (for example: is it critical of America’s involvement in the Vietnam War? How does it convey this criticism?)
- Have certain aspects been dramatized or downplayed? Have central figures or events been excluded?
- Remember to reference any ideas you are using from your research.

5. Assess the reliability of this Rabbit Proof Fence (2002) as a historical source.
	 The source is fairly reliable as it accurately portrays the non-fiction book "Through the Rabbit-Proof Fence" and it's events through the medium of film. However, there are some aspects which limit it's reliability such as the generalisation of events such as the forcible removal of the children from their mother shown as aggressively ripped. While this specific removal might have actually gone about like this, the vast majority of removals weren't like their removals and constructs a generalisation that all removals were forcible, traumatic and violent. The film also portrays the removal system as a "barbaric practice of the past that everyone has moved on from" when it still affects Aboriginal communities today. 

**_Handy Hints:_**

- Assess: To make a judgement, determine the value or importance of something.
- This means you should be making value judgements and considering the overall strength or weakness of the film by making statements such as “This film is _somewhat reliable_” or “This film’s _reliability is limited_ because…”
- Historical source: What does it tell an audience about the past? Does it provide a balanced perspective? Are there issues of stereotype, inaccuracy etc.

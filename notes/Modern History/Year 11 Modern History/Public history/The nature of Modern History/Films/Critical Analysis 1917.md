1. Regarding the film, what can you say about its:
    

  

2. Motive/agenda? 
    
2. Purpose?
    
3. Target audience?
    

The film was made to portray the personal experiences of two soldiers in the war rather than show a large scale run-down of the entire war, out of homage for his grandfather who fought in World War 1. While presenting WW1 in a simplified but accurate manner, the film prioritises storytelling over historical accuracy. The film is aimed at general audiences, students and people who are interested in WW1 or have relatives who fought in WW1. 

  

1. Do you think the film achieved its intention? Why/why not? How?
    

The film achieved its intention of being a simple story following 2 soldiers through the use of various film techniques. For instance, the entire film is edited and filmed to make it seem like it was shot in one take, adding a sense of motion and personal connection to the story that wouldn’t be feasible if the story was wider and tried to encapsulate the entire war. 

  

1. What do you know about the historical accuracy of the film? Does this detract (take away) from the film as a means of exploring public history?
    

  

The film is limited in its accuracy to history, with accurate representation of trench warfare, hierarchy of military and uniforms worn in WW but gross inaccuracies in the movie such as the omission of the broader strategic context of the battle, the real-time journey being drastically shortened and cinematic liberty such as the lone German pilot and the river escape being too convenient. It doesn’t detract from the film as a means of exploring public history as it provides a baseline understanding of the soldiers’ experiences in WW1 but it must be supplemented with a wider variety of sources to make an educated opinion on WW1

  

1. How does this film represent WW1 in the wider discourse of Public History? Good, bad, adds/removes value or significance?
    

  

The film represents WW1 as a chaotic, isolating and terrifying time for the soldiers and portrays WW1 in a largely negative light. The film removes value and significance through an extremely personal and narrow lens, as compared to All Quiet on the Western Front which critiques the war as a whole. 

  

1. How can a film such as 1917, which is only loosely based on fact, still off valuable historical insights?
    

1917, despite being loosely based on fact, offers valuable insight into the experiences of the soldiers directly and gives us new perspectives on the war. Rather than talking about the geopolitical implications of the war, 1917 directly places you in the eyes of the soldiers and their fight for survival and showcases the seeds for anti-war sentiment that would grow bigger during WW2 and Vietnam War. 

  

1. Would you recommend this film to other students learning about WW1 or experiences on the Western Front? Why/why not?
    

  

I would not recommend this film to other students learning about World War 1 or experiences on the western front. It is overly simplified with little information presented about the greater context of the battle and the reasons leading up to this battle. Many sequences such as the cherry blossom sequences are extremely convenient and only exist to service the plot. The film also provides a very narrow view into the experiences of soldiers and doesn’t represent the view of all soldiers on the battle front. 

  

1. The film had a production budget of approximately $100m but grossed $384.6m worldwide. How does 1917 encapsulate the pressure between the need for commercial success and historical accuracy? Can these two aspects ever be compatible?
    

  

1917 leans towards commercial success rather than historical accuracy, using its "one-shot" cinematography and dramatic storytelling to engage audiences while simplifying historical complexities. To ensure mainstream success, it focuses on an emotional, personal journey rather than the broader political context of WWI. There are also many aspects of the film that are unrealistic such as the scene where the soldier floats down the river and the cherry blossoms fall, being overly convenient to service the plot and audience engagement. Despite 1917’s lack of balance in terms of historicity and commercial success/audience engagement, there are films that achieve this balance such as Schindler’s List by Steven Spielberg and The Pianist by Roman Polanski, with both films receiving rave reviews and awards while also gaining huge commercial success.

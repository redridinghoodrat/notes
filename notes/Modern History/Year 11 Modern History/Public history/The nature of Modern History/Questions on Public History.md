#### Back to [[The Nature of Modern History- The Representation of Commemoration of the Past]]


1. a. The film Schindler's List outlines how the Nazis dehumanised the Jewish population, how the Jews were tortured inside these camps and how Nazi supporters or sympathisers like Schindler slowly evolved to grow and help free the Jews from the concentration camps
   b. I believe the movie to be fairly reliable, given there are certain scenes that are dramaticised or information omitted to be more easily digestible to the audience but accurately portraying the bulk of the information
2. Film and television sources do not qualify as valid historical sources as they are very dramaticised and often get factual information partially or completely incorrect. For example, even with the great measures to ensure historical accuracy in the Spike Lee film Malcolm X, it was greatly condensed to make sure it was easily digestible to the public such as the addition of composite characters that were mixtures of multiple real life incidents and left out figures like the current head of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, who was crucial to understanding the dynamics between the NOI and Malcolm X
3. Television footage would be more reliable than photographic evidence as it provides multiple angles and shots to the crowd which is harder to fake than it is on a photograph. 
4. Public uses of history in my area include
		 a.  Experiment Farm run by convict James Ruse
		 b.  Parramatta High School (much of the school has remained unchanged since 1913)
		 c. The Old Government House at Parramatta Park



### Venn Diagram homework (friday)


**Can the information presented on TikTok fit into the field of Public History?**

Yes, it can fit under the field of public history as it does provide historical evidence or interpretations, albeit not reputable or peer-checked, and it is accessible to a wide range of people. 

**What value does it bring to the nature of public history or the discipline of History?

As one of the more open and popular social media platforms online, it broadens the range of people who are exposed to history and build up more interest and discourse in the discipline of history. 

**Kahlil Greene calls himself “Gen Z Historian” – how do we feel about this title?

I think the term is extremely simplified and he doesn't have an official degree in history, however I don't see a problem with using the term to bring in more viewers and build an audience rather than to assert that he's an actual historian. 

**He says his aim is to “[fill] in the gaps of the US education system” - does he have a right
to do this?

He has a right to do this if the government isn't actively trying to improve the education system or if he feels the system isn't correctly explaining the topics at hand.  
Could we apply this approach to the Australian system?

How involved should the govt. be in the structure of how History is taught?

Consider what we know about the uses of history, commemoration and representation

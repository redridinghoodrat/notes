While we know that :
$$ 
Y = C + S
$$
We need to be able to communicate wether one consumer is more or less prepared to spend than another. Therefore, two terminologies are used to answer the question

- Average propensity to consume (APC): The proportion of an individual's income that is spent on consumption
$$ 
C/Y = APC
$$
- Average propensity to save (APS): The proportion of an individual's income that is saved
$$ 
S/Y = APS
$$

Calculate APC and APS for the following schedule:

| Consumer | Income (Y) | Consumption (C) | Saving (S) | APC (C/Y) | APS (S/Y)     | APC+APS  |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Sam      | 100        | 80              | 20         | 80% (0.8) | 20% <br>(0.2) | 100% (1) |
| Alex     | 200        | 100             | 100        | 50% (0.5) | 50% (0.5)     | 100% (1) |

Important things to notice:
- APC & APS are always expressed as decimals
- APC+APS=1, because C+S=Y


Practice:
1. A consumer has an income of 180 and spends 140 of that income on goods and services. Calculate the consumer's average propensity to save
	 $$ APS = 40/180 = 0.22 $$
2. A consumer has an APC of 0.8 and an income of 400. How much does the consumer spend and save. 
$$ APC = 0.8(400) = 320 $$
$$ APS = 400 - 320 $$$$ APS = 80 $$
3. . A consumer has an APC of 0.9 and saves $50. Calculate the income of the consumer

$$ APS = 1 - 0.9 $$
$$ APS = 0.1 $$
$$ 50/Y = 0.1 $$
$$ Y = 50/0.1 $$
$$ Y = 500 $$
### MPC and MPS formulas

- The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) = The proportion of each extra dollar of an individual's income that is SPENT on CONSUMPTION
$$ ChangeC= consumption change, ChangeI= income change
$$$$ MPC = ChangeC/ChangeI $$

|        | Income (Y) | Consumption (C) | Saving (S) | MPC (CHANGEC/CHANGEI) | MPS (CHANGES/CHANGY) | MPS+MPC |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| Year 1 | 100        | 80              | 20         | -                     | -                    | 0       |
| Year 2 | 110        | 85              | 25         | 0.5                   | 0.5                  | 1       |

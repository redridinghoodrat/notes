Back to [[Topic two]], [[Market economies]], [[Consumer sovereignty]] and [[What influences consumption decisions?]]

- The need to purchase consumer durables (goods that don't need to be replaced often)
- To provide for emergencies
- To accumulate wealth
- To leave money as a bequest (something giving or left to others by will)
- To build for speculative purposes (e.g: to buy shares at short notices)
- Cultural factors
	- Some cultures are more inclined to save more
	- People from previous generations tended to save more than people today
- Personality factors
	- Some people are more inclined to save money than spend it
- Expectations about the future
	- People optimistic about the future and a rise in their income are less likely to save 
- Tax policies
	- The tax system can influence an individuals pattern of consumption by making it more or less attractive to spend/save
		- For example, high income taxes reduce disposable income, leading individuals to save less or spend more cautiously
- Availability of credit
	- Spending is higher if credit is widely available and at low interest rate

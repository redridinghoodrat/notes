## Basic rules

- Are consumers willing to pay the price for the item
- Some goods are considered necessities for daily life (e.g: demand for basic food survival won't change dramatically even if the price increases)
- However, consumer demand for other goods, particularly luxury items, will decrease as price increases

### The price of substitute and complement goods

- A substitute is a good that consumers may choose to buy in place of another good. (e.g: A decrease in demand for donutking leads to an increase in demand for krispy kreme)
- A complement is a good that used in conjunction with (alongside) another good. (e.g: a decrease in demand for tennis racquets leads to an decrease in demand for both tennis racquets and tennis balls)
### Consumer tastes and preferences

- Consumer tastes and preferences change over time, so will the demand for certain goods such as fashion etc.
- Advancement in technology leads to consumers demanding new and better products
- This is not limited to just goods and can include even the methods of purchasing goods. Over 68% of Australians, since 2020, have purchased online 

### [[Marketing|Advertising]]

- In 2023, 53 billion dollars was spent on advertising. 
- Advertising creates demand for a particular good or service, regardless of whether it is a necessity or if it is in fashion
- Advertisement makes consumers less responsive to price increases by building brand loyalty amongst consumers. Examples include Apple, who can charge luxury prices for their phones and devices and still make a profit due to their advertising identity and their brand loyalty
- Advertising, like marketing, affects  [[Consumer sovereignty|consumer sovereignty]]  as they are less likely to make an educated choice on purchasing a good

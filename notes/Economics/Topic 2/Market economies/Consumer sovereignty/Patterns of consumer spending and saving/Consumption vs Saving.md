## Relationship between consumption and savings

$$
Y = C +S
$$
Where: 
$$
Y = income , C= costs, S= savings
$$

This equation means that,
- For any specific level of income, any increase in consumption will cause an equal reduction in the level of saving, and vice versa
- Any change in the level of income will result in the change of both levels of consumption and savings


#### Dis-saving

Dis-saving is a situation where consumption is greater than savings, making the income less than consumption. There are many situations where this might occur
- When you are in debt which you cannot pay back
- When you take out a loan

### Who are shareholders?

- Shareholders are people who purchase shares of a company
- These shareholders recieve a return on their investment into this company known as a dividend
- Shareholders are interested in maximising their returns on their investment, such as higher priced dividends/shares. This contrasts with the consumer's view of requiring lower prices

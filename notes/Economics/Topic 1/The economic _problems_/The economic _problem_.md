## The economic "problem"

The economic problem reflects the challenge of balancing society's unlimited wants with limited resources

### ***The characteristic of wants are:

* Wants are unlimited
* Wants change over time
* Wants differ in importance (basic wants vs luxuries)
* Scarcity ensures changes have to be made between wants- establishes a hierarchy in which wants are tackled first

*Resources* are known as factors of production and they are scarce (limited). 

Since we can't satisfy all our wants with limited resources, we must choose between them. Therefore we need to rank our preferences: we choose our highest preference first and leave some wants unsatisfied

**Example:**
Imagine a country has a limited supply of natural resources, e.g oil, but the demand for oil is unlimited. 

##### **Distinguish using examples between individual and collective wants

Individual wants satisfy only the individual's desire for the good/service (e.g: a luxury car or a luxury handbag). Collective wants satisfy the desires of a group of people, usually in the form of intangible concepts (e.g: cheaper housing, free public transport).

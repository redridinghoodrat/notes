#### Economic factors underlying decision-making by:

- individuals  - spending, saving, work, education, retirement, voting and participation in the political processes
- Business - pricing, production, resource use, industrial relations 
- Governments - influencing the decisions of individuals and business

##### Overview of the key factors that influence the economic decisions and choices taken by individuals in the economy:

An individual's spending decision is influenced by:
- Level of income (quality of goods)
- How much to save?
- Future income expectations/job security 
- Age (nature of goods, e.g: new parents vs retirees)
- Work (how many hours/days of work?)
- Retirements (how many years of work before retirement)
- Education (materials for higher-level education that might be expensive)
- Law/policies that influences one's disposable income (taxes, subsidies etc.)

##### Overview of the key factors that influence the economic decisions and choices taken by businesses in the economy:

Business make decisions not only impact the business in terms of revenue, expenses and profits but also impact the utility (satisfaction) and quality of life of consumers.

A business makes decisions in relation to: 
- Pricing - target market? High or low prices? - Ultimate goal: profit maximisation
- Production & Resource use: cost and quality of inputs; pollution?waste? Environmental sustainability, corporate social responsibility (CSR)

	==Higher quality resources==
	==Environmentally sustainable practices==.$=$ Higher production costs

**Economic decisions will also be taken by the business in relation to labour resources, which is referred to as industrial relations. 

- Legal compliance - work health and safety (WHS), anti-discrimination legislation, minimum wages and conditions, training and development activities

##### Overview of the key factors that influence the economic decisions and choices taken by governments in the economy:

- Governments through its economic decisions has the capacity to influence the economic decisions of individuals and businesses in the economy 
- Government intervenes at different stages of the business cycle to either increase or decrease the level of economic activity. These decisions will impact the levels of unemployment, inflation and growth in activity in the economy which will then influence the economic decisions of all the members of that economy, specifically  individuals and businesses (This will be explained in detail in the next section of the syllabus - The operation of economy)
- Government can also directly influence the actions and activities of individuals and businesses. For example: increase tax on tobacco; subsidies offered to households (i.e solar panel), electricity rebate, etc. 
- Provision of public education, public hospitals will impact the decisions of individuals in purchasing and using those services and the decisions of business as to whether they will continue to provide competing or alternate goods and services.



#### Implication of choices

- All of the choices made by each of these groups have an opportunity cost.
- Some of them, such as the decision for an individual to undertake extra education, or a business to invest in capital equipment, have numerous implications in the short term, but tremendous benefits in the long term.
- Society MUST find an appropriate balance between the needs of today and the future growth of the economy.

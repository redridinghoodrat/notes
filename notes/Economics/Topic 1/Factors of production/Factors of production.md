Factors of production 
* Land 
* [[Labour]]
* [[Enterprise]] 
* [[Capital]]

- A factor of production is any resource that can be used in the production of goods and services
- The quality and quantity of an economy's factors of production can influence how rich and/or liveable a country will be (e.g: standard of living)
- For instance, the standard of living in Saudi Arabia, which is rich in oil, is higher than Haiti, with limited natural resources.

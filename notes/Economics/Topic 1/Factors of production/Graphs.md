## (PPF) Possibility frontier graph/curve
A PPF graph represents all the possible combinations of the production of two goods and services that the economy can produce at any given time. This graph is often best used in the calculation of [[Opportunity costs]]. 
### Assumptions to be made:
* The economy only produces these two goods
* The state of technology is constant
* The quality of resources available remains unchanged
* All resources are fully utilised
### Changes to the graphs

* All possible combination of the production of the two goods and services can be detailed into a table which can then be graphed into a PPF graph. 
* To define resources that are not fully utilised, you can portray it as resources that are under the curve/graph. That means there are unemployed resources in the economy. 
* Points cannot be above the curve or graph, as it implies it utilises resources beyond availability and indicates insufficient resources. 
* If technology to produce one of the goods are increased, the graph shifts up for the resource being produced. If new resources are found, the graph shifts upwards. 
### The shape of the graph
* PPF is concave to origin due to increasing marginal opportunity cost. It means there are more and more units of one commodity are sacrificed to gain extra units of the other. 


### Future implication
The choices of each individual, business and government today will have an impact on the PPF in the future. 

#### Consumer goods v. Capital goods

Opportunity costs is the cost of prioritising the next best alternative that we have to forgo to satisfy our more important and valuable initial want. The concept of opportunity costs exist due to the scarcity of resources, meaning decision to go through with the production of one good is made at the expense of other goods and services that could've been produced.  
 

Examples of opportunity costs affecting individuals include:
* Deciding to order pizza instead of cooking
* Studying for a Math exam tomorrow instead of working on a take-home assignment that's due 2 months from now. 

Examples of opportunity costs affecting businesses include:
* A phone company deciding to discontinue production of older phone models in favour of increased production of newer phones

Examples of opportunity costs affecting governments include:
* Passing bills reforming the economy in a recession instead of passing bills reforming civil rights or human rights
* Building more housing instead of increasing forest cover

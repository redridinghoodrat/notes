## What is the circular flow of income

- The circular flow of income refers to the relationship between income received by individuals to profit generated by businesses and how each sector of the economy is interlinked and depends on each other
- The circular flow of income involves "leakages" and "injections". Injections is money that is sent back into the economy and leakages is money that is taken out of circulation
- An example of a leakage would be government taxation
- An example of an injection is government expenditure

### Impacts of Leakages and Injections
- If injections are greater than leakages, the economy will expand
- If leakages are greater than injections, the economy will shrink/contract

|                            | Leakages>Injections                                                        | Injections>Leakages                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level of economic activity | Decreased level of economic activity due to less spending                  | Increased level of economic activity due to more spending                    |
| Level of production        | Decreased level of production due to less demand for goods                 | Increased level of production due to higher demand for goods                 |
| Unemployment               | Increased amount of unemployment due to less demand for goods and services | Decreased amount of unemployment due to higher demand for goods and services |
| Income                     | Decreased income due to lack of economic activity                          | Increased income due to higher levels of economic activity                   |
| Overall economic growth    | Low economic growth                                                        | High economic growth                                                         |

### Equilibrium

Equilibrium is when the total number of leakages is equal to the total number of injections, leading to a net-zero economic growth.
